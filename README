CORTO - your url shortner gem
-----------------------------

- Yet another url shortner?
	
	corto is a ruby gem that shorten a URL for you and store the result in a SQLite3 database.
	Why the world needs another url shortener? Well, true to be told I don't know the answer and I'm 
	pretty sure this code is far away from being revolutionary.
	
	However... it's fun!

- Note on Patches/Pull Requests

	* Fork the project.
	* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
	* Add tests for it. This is important so I don’t break it in a future version unintentionally.
	* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, 
		that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
	* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
